An Inconsolata modification font. Version 1.1

Introduces a rounded lowercase L without the bottom serif, as well as a straight lowercase T instead of the slightly curved one in Inconsolata and finally a more circular lowercase G, which I find matches the font better than the standard Inconsolata lowercase G with its slightly more Gothic curves. This font is more suited towards screen, as it aims to be plain with very little decoration.

Example comparisons coming soon
