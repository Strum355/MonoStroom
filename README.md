[![Github All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/Strum355/MonoStroom/total.svg)]()

An Inconsolata modification font. Version 1.0

Introduces a rounded lowercase L without the bottom serif, as well as a straight lowercase T instead of the slightly curved one in Inconsolata and finally a more circular lowercase G, which I find matches the font better than the standard Inconsolata lowercase G with its slightly more Gothic curves.

Example comparisons coming soon
